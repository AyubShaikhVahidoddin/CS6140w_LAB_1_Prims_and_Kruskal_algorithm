I HAVE DID THIS Code and is compiled and I have uploded code in this online Compiler :
1) Prims Algo   => https://onlinegdb.com/Z8cDcCKnu
2) Kruskal Algo => https://onlinegdb.com/saTa7J4aQ
click on this link it will take you to the project there you can directly RUN the program i have uploded same code in this compiler you can check the code same as in git repo it was created by me so that it is easy for you sir to verify instead downloading the exe sometime it block 
by antivirus so problem to running .exe or creating .exe. please check and let me know in case any issue üëç **

* The time complexity of the Prim's Algorithm is O ( ( V + E ) log V )
* Kruskal's algorithm's time complexity is O(E log V), where V being the number of vertices.
* 
Prims Outpout for this adjecentcy matrix:
